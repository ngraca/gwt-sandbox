/**
 * <p>
 * A listener interface to be notified during the {@link UnifyAst} phase of a gwt compile.
 * <p>
 * Requires GWT 2.5+
 * <p>
 * Currently, the only way for a unify ast listener to be registered is if a class
 * registered as a {@link MagicMethodGenerator} also implements {@link UnifyAstListener}.
 * <p>
 * An instance of this listener will be created, and will have
 * {@link UnifyAstListener#onUnifyAstStart(UnifyAstView, UnifyVisitor, Queue)} called
 * exactly once at the start of the unify ast process.
 * <p>
 * Then, once the normal unify ast process is complete (entry point is visited),
 * the ast parser will then call {@link UnifyAstListener#onUnifyAstPostProcess(UnifyAstView, UnifyVisitor, Queue)}
 * repeatedly, until no UnifyAstListener return true.
 * <p>
 * Finally, {@link UnifyAstListener#destroy()} is called when all listeners are finished
 * their post-processing of the source code.
 * <p>
 * Note that the listener is responsible for attaching method calls to examine.
 * <p>
 * Arbitrary example:
 *<pre>
     JDeclaredType type = ast.searchForTypeBySource("your.fully.qualified.Name");
     for (JMethod method : type.getMethods()) {
      if (method.getName().equals("methodCallToHijack")) {
        JMethodBody body = (JMethodBody)entry.getBody();
        JExpressionStatement inject = getOrMakeStatement(ast);
        // insert our statement wherever
        body.getBlock().addStmt(0, inject);
      }
     }

     public JExpressionStatement getOrMakeStatement(UnifyAstView ast) {
       // Return a JMethodCall, JGwtCreate, or any expressionable statement.
       JDeclaredType type = ast.searchForTypeBySource("your.fully.qualified.HijackerName");
       for (JMethod method : type.getMethods()) {
         if (method.getName().equals("injectedMethod")) {
           return new JMethodCall(method.getSourceInfo(), null, method).makeStatement();
         }
       }
       throw new Error();
     }
